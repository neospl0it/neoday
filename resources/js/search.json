The Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) was released in 1977, but since it contained the Unix code owned by AT&T, a resulting lawsuit limited the development of BSD. Richard Stallman started the GNU project in 1983. His goal was to create a free Unix-like operating system, and part of his work resulted in the GNU General Public License (GPL) being created. Projects by others over the years failed to result in a working, free kernel that would become widely adopted until the creation of the Linux kernel.","At first, Linux was a personal project started in 1991 by a Finnish student named Linus Torvalds. His goal was to create a new, free operating system kernel. Over the years, the Linux kernel has gone from a small number of files written in C under licensing that prohibited commercial distribution to the latest version with over 23 million source code lines (comments excluded), licensed under the GNU General Public License v2.","Linux is available in over 600 distributions (or an operating system based on the Linux kernel and supporting software and libraries). Some of the most popular and well-known being Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, OpenSUSE, elementary, Manjaro, Gentoo Linux, RedHat, and Linux Mint.","Linux is generally considered more secure than other operating systems, and while it has had many kernel vulnerabilities in the past, it is becoming less and less frequent. It is less susceptible to malware than Windows operating systems and is very frequently updated. Linux is also very stable and generally affords very high performance to the end-user. However, it can be more difficult for beginners and does not have as many hardware drivers as Windows.","Since Linux is free and open-source, the source code can be modified and distributed commercially or non-commercially by anyone. Linux-based operating systems run on servers, mainframes, desktops, embedded systems such as routers, televisions, video game consoles, and more. The overall Android operating system that runs on smartphones and tablets is based on the Linux kernel, and because of this, Linux is the most widely installed operating system.","Linux is an operating system like Windows, iOS, Android, or macOS. An OS is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with our computer. That means that an OS manages the whole communication between software and hardware. Also, there exist many different distributions (distro). It is like a version of Windows operating systems.","With the interactive instances, we get access to the Pwnbox, a customized version of Parrot OS.

This directory is generally cleared upon system boot and may be deleted at other times without any warning.","The top-level directory is the root filesystem and contains all of the files required to boot the operating system before other filesystems are mounted, as well as the files required to boot the other filesystems. After boot, all of the other filesystems are mounted at standard mount points as subdirectories of the root.","This directory contains executables used for system administration (binary system files).","This directory contains variable data files such as log files, email in-boxes, web application related files, cron files, and more."]},{"l":"Linux Distributions","p":["Linux distributions - or distros - are operating systems based on the Linux kernel. They are used for various purposes, from servers and embedded devices to desktop computers and mobile phones. Each Linux distribution is different, with its own set of features, packages, and tools. Some popular examples include:","Ubuntu","Fedora","CentOS","Debian","Red Hat Enterprise Linux","Many users choose Linux for their desktop computers because it is free, open source, and highly customizable. Ubuntu and Fedora are two popular choices for desktop Linux and beginners. It is also widely used as a server operating system because it is secure, stable, and reliable and comes with frequent and regular updates. Finally, we, as cybersecurity specialists, often prefer Linux because it is open source, meaning its source code is available for scrutiny and customization. Because of such customization, we can optimize and customize our Linux distribution the way we want and configure it for specific use cases only if necessary.","We can use those distros everywhere, including (web) servers, mobile devices, embedded systems, cloud computing, and desktop computing. For cyber security specialists, some of the most popular Linux distributions are but are not limited to:","ParrotOS","Raspberry Pi OS","BackBox","BlackArch","Pentoo","The main differences between the various Linux distributions are the included packages, the user interface, and the tools available. Kali Linux is the most popular distribution for cyber security specialists, including a wide range of security-focused tools and packages. Ubuntu is widespread for desktop users, while Debian is popular for servers and embedded systems. Finally, red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS are popular for enterprise-level computing."]},{"l":"Debian","p":["Debian is a widely used and well-respected Linux distribution known for its stability and reliability. It is used for various purposes, including desktop computing, servers, and embedded system. It uses an Advanced Package Tool ( apt) package management system to handle software updates and security patches. The package management system helps keep the system up-to-date and secure by automatically downloading and installing security updates as soon as they are available. This can be executed manually or set up automatically.","Debian can have a steeper learning curve than other distributions, but it is widely regarded as one of the most flexible and customizable Linux distros. The configuration and setup can be complex, but it also provides excellent control over the system, which can be good for advanced users. The more control we have over a Linux system, the more complex it feels to become. However, it just feels that way compared to the options and possibilities we get. Without learning it with the required depth, we might spend way more time configuring “easy” tasks and processes than when we would learn to use a few commands and tools more in-depth. We will see it in the Filter Contents and Find Files and Directories sections.","Stability and reliability are key strengths of Debian. The distribution is known for its long-term support releases, which can provide updates and security patches for up to five years. This can be especially important for servers and other systems that must be up and running 24/7. It has had some vulnerabilities, but the development community has quickly released patches and security updates. In addition, Debian has a strong commitment to security and privacy, and the distribution has a well-established security track record. Debian is a versatile and reliable Linux distribution that is widely used for a range of purposes. Its stability, reliability, and commitment to security make it an attractive choice for various use cases, including cyber security."]},{"l":"Introduction to Shell","p":["It is crucial to learn how to use the Linux shell, as there are many servers based on Linux. These are often used because Linux is less error-prone as opposed to Windows servers. For example, web servers are often based on Linux. Knowing how to use the operating system to control it effectively requires understanding and mastering Linux’s essential part, the Shell. When we first switched from Windows to Linux, does it look something like this:","A Linux terminal, also called a shell or command line, provides a text-based input/output (I/O) interface between users and the kernel for a computer system. The term console is also typical but does not refer to a window but a screen in text mode. In the terminal window, commands can be executed to control the system.","We can think of a shell as a text-based GUI in which we enter commands to perform actions like navigating to other directories, working with files, and obtaining information from the system but with way more capabilities."]},{"l":"Terminal Emulators","p":["Terminal emulation is software that emulates the function of a terminal. It allows the use of text-based programs within a graphical user interface ( GUI). There are also so-called command-line interfaces ( CLI) that run as additional terminals in one terminal. In short, a terminal serves as an interface to the shell interpreter.","Terminal emulators and multiplexers are beneficial extensions for the terminal. They provide us with different methods and functions to work with the terminal, such as splitting the terminal into one window, working in multiple directories, creating different workspaces, and much more. An example of the use of such a multiplexer called Tmux could look something like this:"]},{"l":"Shell","p":["The most commonly used shell in Linux is the Bourne-Again Shell (BASH), and is part of the GNU project. Everything we do through the GUI we can do with the shell. The shell gives us many more possibilities to interact with programs and processes to get information faster. Besides, many processes can be easily automated with smaller or larger scripts that make manual work much easier.","Besides Bash, there also exist other shells like Tcsh/Csh, Ksh, Zsh, Fish shell and others."]},{"l":"Prompt Description","p":["\\@","\\d","\\D{%Y-%m-%d}","\\H","\\j","\\n","\\r","\\s","\\t","\\u","\\w","Carriage return","Current time","Current time 12-hour (HH:MM:SS)","Current time 24-hour (HH:MM:SS)","Current username","Customizing the prompt can be a useful way to make your terminal experience more personalized and efficient. It can also be a helpful tool for troubleshooting and problem-solving, as it can provide important information about the system’s state at any given time.","Date (Mon Feb 6)","Date (YYYY-MM-DD)","Description","For example, when we upload and run a shell on the target system, we may not see the username, hostname, and current working directory. This may be due to the PS1 variable in the environment not being set correctly. In this case, we would see the following prompts:","Full hostname","Full path of the current working directory","However, we see the same as when working on the Windows GUI here. We are logged in as a user on a computer with a specific name, and we know which directory we are in when we navigate through our system. Bash prompt can also be customized and changed to our own needs. The adjustment of the bash prompt is outside the scope of this module. However, we can look at the bash-prompt-generator and powerline, which gives us the possibility to adapt our prompt to our needs.","In addition to customizing the prompt, we can customize their terminal environment with different color schemes, fonts, and other settings to make their work environment more visually appealing and easier to use.","In addition to providing basic information like the current user and working directory, we can customize to display other information in the prompt, such as the IP address, date, time, the exit status of the last command, and more. This is especially useful for us during our penetration tests because we can use various tools and possibilities like script or the .bash_history to filter and print all the commands we used and sort them by date and time. For example, the prompt could be set to display the full path of the current working directory instead of just the current directory name, which can also include the target’s IP address if we work organized.","It can be customized to provide useful information to the user. The format can look something like this:","Name of the shell","Newline","Number of jobs managed by the shell","Privileged - Root Shell Prompt","Special Character","The bash prompt is easy to understand and, by default, includes information such as the user, hostname, and current working directory. It is a string of characters displayed on the terminal screen that indicates that the system is ready for our input. It typically includes information such as the current user, the computer’s hostname, and the current working directory. The prompt is usually displayed on a new line, and the cursor is positioned after the prompt, ready for the user to start typing a command.","The dollar sign, in this case, stands for a user. As soon as we log in as root, the character changes to a hash <#> and looks like this:","The home directory for a user is marked with a tilde <~> and is the default folder when we log in.","The prompt can be customized using special characters and variables in the shell’s configuration file (.bashrc for the Bash shell).
